## How to Play! 
Upon the start of each round, each player begins moving around the map, strategically using their abilities to either set fire to tiles or douse tiles in water to prevent fires from spreading. Players must handle obstacles in the environment, track their resource gauge, and keep an eye on what their opponent is doing throughout the game. Make use of your given abilities and develop new strategies to prevent your opponent from controlling the map by the end of each round!

Each player has 4 abilities to use throughout the game. For both players, abilities 2 and 3 have a cooldown and cannot be used in rapid succession. All abilities also have a ‘fuel cost’ so they can only use abilities if they have enough fuel available. 

### Firetruck Player 
Forward/Backward Movement: W/S 

Left/Right Movement: A/D
- You can only turn when the character is in motion!

Camera Orientation: Move the Mouse/Trackpad 

Water Gun (toggle-able): 1
- This shoots out a trail of water from the front of the firetruck that changes the state of the tile(s) that it hits to have a ‘wet’ condition. This can be used to put out fires as well as make tiles temporarily unable to be ignited.

Sprinkler: 2
- This will summon a fire hydrant that sprays water in a circle, which douses the surrounding tiles.

Hydropump: 3
- This increases the size of the firetruck character and shoots out a larger stream of water from the front of the fire truck. It has the same effect as the water gun, but it covers a larger area. This lasts for a short period of time and has a cooldown.

Sandbags: 4
- This ability places sandbags on top of the tiles, which will slow down the other player if they pass through them. This lasts for a short period of time.

### Wildfire Player 
Forward/Backward Movement: W/S

Left/Right Movement: A/D
- You can only turn when the character is in motion!

Camera Orientation: Move the Mouse/Trackpad 

Ignite/Deignite (toggle-able): 1
- This ability can be toggled on/off. When the player is in the ‘ignite’ state, they can set fire to tiles that they are on as long as those tiles are not burnt out grass or wet grass. 

Fan: 2
- This ability summons a fan for a period of time that can blow fire across tiles in the direction it is facing. The direction matches the forward direction of the player. This has a cooldown.

Firenado: 3
- This increases the character's size, and when they are in ignite mode, it will ignite more tiles than the regular-sized character. This lasts for a short period of time and has a cooldown.

Firewall: 4
- This places a ‘wall of fire’ on the top of the tiles that slows down the other player if they pass through them. This lasts for a short period of time.
